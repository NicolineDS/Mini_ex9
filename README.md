My flowchart
I chose to make a flowchart from my mini_ex6 because it was the one I believe I had the most difficult time making. It was the mini_ex where we were assigned to make a class, for loop/ loop and a conditional statement. By having tree different aspects there was to be included in the program it required me to have a rather precise idea of what to create.
When I made the flowchart I could not decide which aspects of the program I wanted to include or if it only should show how to make the written code.  
Another thing I found changeling was which shape I should use in the different parts of the flowchart, and even with the finished product I am not quite certain that I have done it correctly. Furthermore I think I have made a rather simple flowchart there should generate a good understanding of how to create the program I made for my Mini_ex6.

Making the flowchart for my own program by myself was different and I believe even more challenging process than making a flowchart in groups. This is because I had to decide which parts of the program I found the most important to include in my flowchart and that I had to find out my self how to connect the different parts of the flowchart so it would be understandable for anyone. This is also something that is enlightened in the text “What is an Algorithm,” by Ed Finn. He says that an algorithm is like a recipe that you need to follow to get a certain outcome. This is where the flowchart is a great tool to help the user of an algorithm to understand where to start and what the outcome should be.

When we made the flowcharts in groups it was a lot different. Here we used most of our time deciding what our programs should be about and which conceptual aspects we wanted to include. When it came to creating the flowcharts we used a whiteboard so every member of the group could come with suggestions to what the flowchart should contain and what it should look like. 

Group flowchart
The first idea we came up with was a Twitterbot. The bot should be a profile of a man that would retweet twits with the #MeToo. We wanted to create this so see what difference it would make if a man twitted the same twits. This program should not be made to make fun of the MeToo campaign but should be seen as a way of putting things into perspective and see if there would be the same reaction if a man twitted the same things or it would be ignored.
For this program we would have to get some Twitter API and create a program that could send tweets by it self.

The second program is inspired by the text Benjamin Grosser, ”What Do Metrics Want? How Quantification Prescribes Social Interaction on Facebook,”The program should be a Facebook like interface where the different metrics of the interface would be changed. This could for an example be, that if a user scroll pass a post the person who has posted it would get a notification that would say “this user has ignored your post”.
For this program we would have to make a Facebook like page with a lot of different interaction opportunities.

Both programs would take a lot of time coding and conceptually create. Therefore it was a good exercise to make flowcharts to see what it would take to create each program and what we should have in mind if we chose to create ether of them. Ether way is was a good way of getting familiar with flowcharts and a great way of brainstorming for our final project.
